*Left: logistic classification of three clusters with ridge regularisation for different values of the regularisation's strength λ. Center and right: test error and training error performing a ridge classification of a mixture of K=3 clusters with diagonal covariance in the high dimensional limit, with thoretical predictions compared with the results of numerical simulations.*

## Structure

In this repository we provide the code and some guided example to help the reader to reproduce the figures of the paper [1]. The repository is structured as follows.

| File                          | Description                                                                                                                                                    |

| ```/K2mix``` | Solver for the fixed point equations of the order parameters in the case of classification tasks on K=2 Gaussian clusters with nonhomogeneous diagonal covariances. The notebook ```how_to.ipynb``` provides a step-by-step explanation on how to use the package. This implementation has been used to produce the results in Section 3.1 of the paper.           |

The notebooks are self-explanatory.
